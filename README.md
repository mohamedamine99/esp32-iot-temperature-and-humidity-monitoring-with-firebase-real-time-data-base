# esp32-iot-temperature-and-humidity-monitoring-with-firebase-real-time-data-base
------------------------------------------------------------------------


ESP32 is a powerful hardware platform for IoT applications and is widely used for prototyping and development of IoT applications.

This prject will demonstrate the fastest method to connect your ESP32 to Googleâ€™s Firebase backend. Firebase has become a very convenient option for developers to rapidly prototype their ideas, in this tutorial we lay the ground work for the development of a realtime temperature and humidity monitoring solution. 

This tutorial further demostrates how to interface the DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor with the ESP32 using Arduino IDE and how to upload sensor data on google Firebase's  realtime database .

## Getting Started

### Hardware Requirements:
* ESP32 development board (any ESP32 board is okay, for this project we will be using the ESP32 DevKit v1).
* DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor.
* x2 RGB LEDs
* x6 390 ohm resistors
* one 10K resistor
* Breadboard
* Wires

### software Requirements:
* Arduino IDE (If you haven't already installed or configured it using esp32, check this awesome [tutorial](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/installing-the-esp32-board-in-arduino-ide-windows-instructions/) by Rui Santos
